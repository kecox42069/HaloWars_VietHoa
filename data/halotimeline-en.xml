         Dự án ORION, nó là dự án nguyên mẫu về SPARTAN - một dự án trong đó cả Chính phủ Quân sự (Colonial Military Administration) cố gắng thành lập một đội siêu chiến binh để thực hiện các hoạt động quân sự bí mật ở Outer Colonies. Mặc dù những Spartan này đạt được một số thành công, nhưng sức mạnh của họ không đáp ứng được kỳ vọng ban đầu, đồng thời chi phí phát triển và thực hiện quá lớn đến mức dự án phải bị hủy bỏ. Những người lính trong dự án này sau đó đã được chuyển đến đội quân đặc biệt khác.

         The shield world that Regret intended to activate was one of just a few that the Covenant had uncovered in the quest for the Halos. These treasure chests of technology enabled the Covenant to quickly gain access to advanced weaponry and space propulsion systems allowing them to dominate the galaxy.

         Pelicans engaged in ground operations on the outside of the shell planet failed invariably within four to five flights. The dust adhered to the intakes during entry into the planetary atmosphere in an almost defensive manner, as if the planet itself did not want any space vehicles descending down to its surface.

         The decision to burn bodies infected with the virus was not taken lightly, but the danger to the crew, and the sheer voracity of the infection made taking the bodies aboard Spirit of Fire impossible. Study of the virus and its effects also seems unwise given that we are not equipped with any quarantine labs or have the faintest idea how the virus spreads.

         The artificial construction of this "world" was far beyond the Covenant. Indeed, they seemed to be scavenging this technology for their own use and were unable to operate the machinery, either by design or advancement. The fact my hand was required to unlock the device leads me to believe the original builders of the planet may have had some knowledge about humans.

         The UNSC designates Spirit of Fire as "lost with all hands." The previous designation of "missing" had given hope to family and friends. The reason for the change is classified top secret. A memorial service is held for the crew, but many prominent family members do not attend, holding out hope that their loved ones are still alive.

         The Second Fall of Arcadia. The Covenant left Arcadia alone after their first attack on the planet in 2531 but the humans mostly abandoned it, leaving the capital city Pirth to nature. Eventually a small rural farming community started Abaskun, a rich farmland area on the continent of Mu. Although mostly lawless, the area provided much needed food supplies to the UNSC until the planet was attacked again by the Covenant in the fall of 2549.

To preserve discipline between the Sangheili overseers and Unggoy, choice of victim and execution is to be by Kig-Yar death squads. This to continue daily until that vessel's Luminary is installed.

         Twenty-five of the twenty-eight surviving SPARTAN-IIs, including SPARTAN-117, are recalled to Reach to be briefed on the Covenant threat and to receive their new orders: board a damaged Covenant vessel, use a "mission specialist" to crack the Covenant computer system, and locate the Covenant homeworld. Once accomplished, a covert team will be dispatched to capture the Covenant leadership and broker a truce by force. Despite recent successes, the human military is being systematically slaughtered, and this may be the only chance for survival.
